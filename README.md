# BesuUpgradeableSmartContracts
This repository contains smart contracts deployed on a Besu private network using the Create2 factory pattern. The contracts follow the TransparentUpgradeableProxy pattern, enabling future upgrades by the development team. All deployed contracts share unified addresses across networks, allowing for seamless interaction and updates.
